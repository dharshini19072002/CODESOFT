1.User Interface (UI):
    You can use libraries like Qt or GTK for building the graphical user interface. These libraries offer extensive widgets and design options.
2.Image Loading and Display:
     Use a library like OpenCV to load and display images.
3.Image Filters:
     Implement basic filters using OpenCV, such as grayscale, blur, brightness, contrast adjustment, and sharpening.
4.Crop and Resize:
     Allow users to select regions for cropping and provide options for resizing. OpenCV can handle these operations efficiently.
5.Image Saving:
    utilize OpenCV to save the processed image in various formats.
6.User Interaction:
    Implement event handlers to capture user actions like button clicks and mouse events.

       program
      
       
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
int main() {
    // Load an image
    cv::Mat originalImage = cv::imread("input.jpg", cv::IMREAD_COLOR);
    
    // Check if the image was loaded successfully
    if (originalImage.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not open or find the image!" << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Convert the image to grayscale
    cv::Mat grayscaleImage;
    cv::cvtColor(originalImage, grayscaleImage, cv::COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
    
    // Display the grayscale image
    cv::imshow("Grayscale Image", grayscaleImage);
    
    // Save the grayscale image
    cv::imwrite("output.jpg", grayscaleImage);
    
    cv::waitKey(0); // Wait for user input

    return 0;
}
